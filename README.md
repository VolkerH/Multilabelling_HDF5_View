## About
This is an interactive viewer for multilabelling images in HDF5 format. This is a specific structure in an hdf5-container developed for our multilabelling acquisition (Publication forthcoming), a protocol for automated stainging, imaging and bleaching on a microscope stage, allowing highly multiplexed imaging at confocal resolution.
